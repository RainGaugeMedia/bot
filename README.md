**Please note:** the refactored code is in the directory named `clean`. I realize it is not the most efficient way but I wanted to _cleanly_ show what I attempted to explain during my alotted time without changing the algorithm to show my original thought process without scouring the internet...anyone can do that.

The `original` directory shows what was actually done in my alotted time in the file `in-alotted-time.ts` and the rushed completed version of that in `completed.ts`. 

I didn't spend much time refactoring, but knowing I rushed the completed, I couldn't leave it alone....

Thank you all for your time!
